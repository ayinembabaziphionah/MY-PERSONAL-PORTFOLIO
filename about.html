    <p>I strive for excellence in everything I do and am a firm believer in leaving each place or situation that I cross paths within a better condition than I found it. Being a student in a girls' institution has inspired me to be living proof that women are valuable in tech and in the workforce as men.
I volunteered to design our school magazine for 2017-2018 during my high school. Therefore am bringing this determination and ambition to obtain my diploma in information technology at AkiraChix campus of which I hope at the end of my course I will have achieved the following skills in the areas listed.

Other skills in frontend mobile development.  </p>
